# Farewell

I write all of this for myself as a diary of my surviving in order to get rid of this disease.
I'll do like this in every next repo to count my changes, this will motivate me to work harder for being better.
I know nobody will read this.
I'm so depressed I ask the Universe to never wake up, and you expect me to do homeworks on time?
I'll list here some recent things which happened with me and made me think of passing away more often than I used to.
1. November 2023 - one of my old close patients died because of our corrupted clinic.
2. December 2023 - breaking up with someone I loved.
3. December 2023 - another old patient died but not so close to me.
4. December 2023 - my nurse was fired so I had double work which is not payed.
5. December 2023 - unsuccessful attempt to conflict with our directors and prove their dirty work.
6. December 2023 - unsuccessful attempt to make up with ex.
7. December 2023 - lost my colleague in Russian attack.
8. January 2024 - my old friend appeared to have brain cancer, trying my best to help her.
9. January 2024 - having no money, taking debts.
10. January 2024 - taking pause in volunteering.
11. January 2024 - complete cut of speaking with ex.
12. January 2024 - unsuccessful attempt to suicide.

I admit my weakness and my hate to myself grows day by day.
I lost people who would support me now, except one.
Sometimes it's unbearably difficult just to get up.
I can't finish like this. I should follow my main principles regardless.
I'm the only one who will help me.
I promise myself to try harder and prove myself I'm strong, so other READMEs will be filled with my achievements.
